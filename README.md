## What Is It?

The **Paragon Operations Map** is an internal operations management tool built for **Paragon Property Management**. It provides a single source of truth for all operational responsibilities, ownership assignments, and organizational structure as the company scales from **~150 to 300–500 managed units**.

The tool answers three critical questions at a glance:

1. **What work exists?** — Every operational task across all 17 departments, documented and organized.
2. **Who owns it?** — Every task is assigned to a named team member or flagged as UNOWNED.
3. **Where are the gaps?** — Unowned responsibilities surface automatically, so nothing falls through the cracks.

## The Operational Problem It Solves

In a growing property management company, operational responsibility spreads across leasing, maintenance, accounting, compliance, tenant relations, and more. Without a structured system:

- Tasks go unclaimed and tenants, owners, or vendors fall through the cracks
- Onboarding new team members is slow because no single document captures "who does what"
- Leadership can't identify overloaded team members or understaffed departments
- Scaling decisions (hiring, role creation, process automation) are made without full visibility

The Paragon Operations Map gives leadership and the operations team **complete visibility** — across 17 departments, 350+ tasks, and 8 team members — in a single interactive interface.
